# ASSIG2
1. *I started to play around with github because I didn't know how to ceate a branch, but I somehow stumble upon making the branch.*
2.**Once I Figured how to create a branch, I later asked Nidhi how to commit and change the file name she showed me how to do it.**
>Writing a readme file was a bit difficult because I didn't understand it correctly until Nidhi helped me out once again.
